#Blackjack Game with GUI and SQLite3


Overview
This project is a Blackjack game built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite3 for managing player data and game statistics. The game allows players to place bets, interact with the dealer, and track their chips and progress across sessions.

Features

Betting system: Players can place bets before each round, with chips being tracked throughout the game.
Persistent player profiles: Player data, including chips, wins, and losses, are saved and loaded across sessions using an SQLite3 database.
Card visualization: The game dynamically displays cards for both the player and dealer, updating in real time.
Error handling: Input validation and error handling ensure smooth gameplay, even with unexpected user inputs.
Technologies Used
Python: Core game logic and GUI development.
Tkinter: For building the graphical interface.
SQLite3: To store player data, game statistics, and betting history.
