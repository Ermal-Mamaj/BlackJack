# BlackJack
Code for a simple blackjack game between you and the dealer !
Rules: Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21, a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10 . Ace may have to values depending on your hand , if your hand value(excluding the ace) is more than 11 ,the value of ace is 11, otherwise the ace is worth one (two aces in one hand might have different values).
